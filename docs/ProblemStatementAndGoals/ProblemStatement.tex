\section{Problem Statement}

\paragraph{Current behavioral neuroscience research on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is limited by the lack of accessible tools for managing and analyzing large-scale animal model data sets. With roughly 20,000 trials worth of rat behavioural data, the data was compiled into one of the most extensive data sets in the field, containing video recordings of rat behaviour with corresponding spatial-temporal tracking data, and additional research files. Although the data set is publicly accessible and contains rich and diverse forms of data, it is not presented in a user-friendly way for researchers to use it. The current state of the data set impacts researchers by making it difficult to synchronize trajectories with video recordings and extract meaningful insights from correlated data types. This gap in infrastructure reduces the scientific utility of an extensive data set, ultimately slowing the pace of discovery through research.}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the

{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Extras}

\wss{For CAS 741: State whether the project is a research project. This
designation, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  (The full list is on the course outline and in
Lecture 02.) Normally the number of extras will be two.  Approval of the extras
will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project.
The extras, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
\end{enumerate}
