\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\par{ The components of the system that will be subject to the hazard analysis are as follows:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The FRDR Database:} All 29 individual datasets and 60,000 relevant data objects that exist on this repository. Note that this component is
    incorporated into the system in a read-only fashion meaning that at no point in the system creation will any part of it be changed, developed or written to
    with the exception of Dr. Henry Szechtman or Dr. Anna Dvorkin-Gheva depositing more data into the repository, the execution of which is seperate from the system.
    \item \textbf{Front-End Query Application:} A front-end web application that provides access for users to query results from the system. This component contains
    some subcomponents
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Natural Language Processor:} This subcomponent takes in natural language input and uses an LLM to generate a relevant query.
            \item \textbf{Filter Query Engine:} This subcomponent allows the user to manually add filters based on trial data and generates a relevant query.
            \item \textbf{Webstore Query Engine:} This subcomponent provides pre-defined result sets that may be relevant to the user for the user to browse and
            use if relevant.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{API Layer:} An API layer will be implemented to connect the constructed system with the FRDR database. This layer will be responsible for 
    retrieving the relevant data from the FRDR for each individual query.
    \item \textbf{Backend System:} This component includes several subcomponents:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Database Schema:} This subcomponent is a database scehma which unifies the datasets into one schema while also connecting the metadata annotations
            and related data objects in the format of a relational DBMS and points to the FRDR database.
            \item \textbf{Behavioural Analysis LLM:} This subcomponent contains the business logic and an LLM model responsible for categorizing the trials
            based on compulsive behaviour or rat poses.
            \item \textbf{Visualization Engine:} This subcomponent is responsible for taking a result set and generating requested visualizations from it.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
