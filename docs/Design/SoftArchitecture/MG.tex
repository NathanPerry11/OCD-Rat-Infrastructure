\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acUIDesign}:] The layout, accessibility, 
  and responsiveness of the front-end interface.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acQueryLLM}:] Fine-tuning or using a 
  different query NLP Model.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acFiltersAndQueryParameters}:] The constraints of filter and query 
  metadata field inputs.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acDataVisualization}:] The framework used for 
  creating visualizations from data and presenting them.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acProcessingAlgorithms}:] The algorithms implemented for 
  behavioural analysis or classification.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acDatasetHosting}:] The virtual hosting location of 
  Dr. Szechtman's dataset.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acAccessControl}:] The implementation of the user authentication 
  and access control mechanism for scalability.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acErrorAndFaultHandling}:] The implementation of 
  error detection and fault recovery mechanisms.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acSecurityAndDependencyUpdates}:] The implementation of 
  application security and dependency monitoring strategies.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucReadOnlyDataset}:] The read-only access 
  to Dr. Szechtman's dataset.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucSoleDataSource}:] The dataset hosted on FRDR 
  being our primary and individual data source.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucDataProcessingScope}:] Scope of data 
  processing analysis (Does not generalize rat behaviour trial data to other animal models 
  or domains).
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucMVCDesignPattern}:] The software application's MVC design pattern.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] Input/Output devices
  (Input: File and/or Keyboard, Output: File, Memory, and/or Screen).
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucUserComputingDevice}:] User's computing device 
  (The assumption that the user's device will support modern browsers with Javascript enabled, 
  will not change)
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design}

The design of the behavioral neuroscience data analysis platform was guided directly by the requirements defined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS). Each design decision was made to ensure that researchers can efficiently access, explore, and analyze complex spatial-temporal behavioral datasets through a user-friendly web interface. The system design is modular, allowing for clear traceability between requirements and their implementation in specific architectural components. Table~\ref{tab:req_design} outlines the connection between key requirements and the corresponding design modules.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Connection Between Requirements and Design}
\label{tab:req_design}
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|p{6cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Requirement ID} & \textbf{Design Module} & \textbf{Design Decision / Rationale} \\ \hline
FUNC.R.1 -- Store and manage behavioral datasets & Database Design Module & Implemented a PostgreSQL schema supporting spatial-temporal data, video references, and metadata to ensure efficient storage and retrieval. \\ \hline
FUNC.R.2 -- Query and filter trials & API Layer (FastAPI) & Designed REST API endpoints to allow parameterized and natural language-based querying of trial data. \\ \hline
FUNC.R.3 -- Visualize trajectories and metrics & Data Visualization Module & Built React components using visualization libraries to render spatial trajectories, behavioral heatmaps, and statistical summaries. \\ \hline
APP.R.1 -- Enable intuitive researcher interaction & Frontend Interface (React) & Designed accessible interfaces for non-technical users, emphasizing usability, clarity, and responsive design. \\ \hline
APP.R.2 -- Natural language querying & NLP Integration Layer & Integrated a language model API to interpret user queries and translate them into structured data retrieval commands. \\ \hline
SYS.R.1 -- Scalable and performant system & Backend Infrastructure Module & Implemented Redis caching and efficient database indexing to support large dataset queries and concurrent users. \\ \hline
SYS.R.2 -- Secure and reliable data access & Authentication and Access Control Module & Applied user authentication, HTTPS protocols, and access management to protect research data integrity. \\ \hline
SYS.R.3 -- Extensible architecture for future analysis tools & Processing Pipeline Module & Designed modular Python-based pipelines for processing coordinate data and computing behavioral measures, allowing future algorithm integration. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The table above illustrates how the high-level design maps to the system’s defined requirements. For example, the \textit{Database Design Module} directly supports the need for structured data management, while the \textit{Video Integration Module} fulfills the requirement to visualize behavioral trajectories alongside synchronized recordings. The decision to use a modular web architecture (FastAPI + React) ensures scalability and maintainability, while also providing researchers with a seamless, interactive environment for exploring and analyzing OCD behavioral datasets.


The table above explicitly documents the connections between system requirements and their corresponding design modules. Each mapping illustrates how specific architectural decisions were made to fulfill the intended functionality, performance, and reliability objectives. For example, to satisfy data security requirements, MinIO access control policies were implemented; to support performance goals, the data conversion pipeline was parallelized; and to meet modularity and maintainability goals, the system was containerized using Docker.

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\wss{The intention of this section is to document decisions that are made
  ``between'' the requirements and the design.  To satisfy some requirements,
  design decisions need to be made.  Rather than make these decisions implicit,
  they are explicitly recorded here.  For instance, if a program has security
  requirements, a specific design decision may be made to satisfy those
  requirements with a password.}

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

REMOVE********
Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\wss{The uses relation is not a data flow diagram.  In the code there will often
be an import statement in module A when it directly uses module B.  Module B
provides the services that module A needs.  The code for module A needs to be
able to see these services (hence the import statement).  Since the uses
relation is transitive, there is a use relation without an import, but the
arrows in the diagram typically correspond to the presence of import statement.}

\wss{If module A uses module B, the arrow is directed from A to B.}
