\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\par{The following section will outline a verification and validation plan to follow throughout the project timeline. 
Since our development of the project is executed in multiple sequential steps, this section will outline the verification and validation 
plans, as well as the tools and methods used for each milestone component leading up to our final software solution. This section will also 
list the entities that will participate in the verification and validation steps. First we will outline who will be involved in the 
verification and validation team. Then we will discuss the verification plans of the SRS, design, VnV Plan, implementation, and 
the automatic tools we use for testing and verification. Lastly, we will discuss how we will perform the validation of our software.}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item{\textbf{Aidan Goodyer},\textbf{Jeremy Orr},\textbf{Nathan Perry},\textbf{Timothy Pokanai},\textbf{Leo Vugert}:}
   \par{The five members of the capstone team will split the testing evenly among themselves. All members will be equally expected to
  contribute to the synthesis of both unit and system tests as well as setting up automated tests down the line. Since the author of the System Testing plan was \textbf{Jeremy Orr}
  and the author of the Unit Testing plan will be \textbf{Nathan Perry}, they will be considered the head of system testing and unit testing respectively. Although
  this does not require them to necessarily produce more tests, they will be expected to be prepared to provide guidance to other group members if they need it.}
  \item{\textbf{Dr. Henry Szechtman}, \textbf{Dr. Anna Dvorkin-Gheva}:} 
  \par{ The two supervisors of this project will be involved in the testing process as if they were early
  access users. Given that they represent a demographic very similar to what our actual users will look like (Albeit with a much better understanding of the data),
  their feedback will be extremely useful in understanding how well our system will be recieved by users. They will perform both User Acceptance Testing and
  and Usability testing on our system; trying out the various functionalities and commenting on if they think it is satisfactory and understandable for the
  general user base.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{SRS Verification}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsubsection{SRS Verification Approaches}

\begin{itemize}

  \item{\textbf{Peer Reviewers: } Our first approach for SRS verification is reviewing the peer review issues created by our classmates. This
  is not the most rigorous or systematic but allows us to evaluate feedback on our SRS and based on these comments, determine if the SRS is consistent,
  correct, feasible and complete or if changes are needed.}
  \item{\textbf{ Unstructured Supervisor SRS Review: } Our second approach for SRS verification is to provide our SRS document to our supervisor, Dr. Henry Szechtman and
  allow him to make comments on it. This approach is also quite unstructured but is still useful in our verification process. By giving our supervisor
  the time to look over the SRS, it will elicit any large gaps between our understanding of his goals for the system and our interpretation of these goals
  during our meetings to elicit said requirements. In other words, this will show us any glaring issues in our requirements from the perspective of our
  supervisor.}
  \item{\textbf{Structured Supervisor SRS Review: } Our third approach for SRS verification also involves our supervisor but in a much more structured manner.
  Our approach to this review would be a meeting in which we present to him the key aspects of the SRS and ask him if he sees any issues with these key sections.
  The main sections (note these do not necessarily refer to specific sections in the SRS template itself) to be covered, in descending order of priority are: Functional Requirements and Use Cases, Project Constraints and Scope, Non-Functional Requirements, Project
  Drivers and Project Issues. During this review we would ask him things like: Is this section complete? Is there anything missing? Does the way we laid out
  these requirements seem correct to you? Do these requirements seem feasible to you? Is this in accordance with your conception of what the system will look like?}
  \item{\textbf{Structured Team SRS Review: } Our final approach for SRS verification will be a review in a much similar format to the structured supervisor
  review but only with the five members of our team. We would go over the same key aspects of the SRS and ask mostly the same questions regarding these sections
  as we would in our supervisor review. Doing an internal review like this will be helpful as although the SRS was generated collectively, the actual writing
  of the requirements was done in a very individual and compartmentalized way and this gives each member an opportunity to closely examine the key parts of our
  requirements and provide and criticisms, issues or additions that they feel are necessary to each section.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{SRS Verification Checklist}

\par{Below is a general checklist of questions that our SRS should satisfy (i.e. the answer should be yes):}

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Are all of the functional requirements necessary, feasible, complete and provide unique value to the system?}
  \item{Do the functional requirements cover every expected function of the system?}
  \item{Are all of the use cases necessary, feasible and complete?}
  \item{Do the existing use cases cover every expected function of the system?}
  \item{Does the SRS cover every relevant project constraint such that there is no unaccounted for aspect of the environment that
  may prevent us from implementing some of the system's functionality?}
  \item{Are all project constraints accurately described such that it is clear what exactly is constrained and it is understandable how
  this may affect the system?}
  \item{Is the scope properly defined such that all project components have been accounted for in the scope?}
  \item{Have all relevant out of scope components been listed and rationale provided for why they are out of scope?}
  \item{Are all non-functional requirements necessary, feasible, complete and provide unique value to the system?}
  \item{For non-functional requirements that are not completely necessary, is their value large enough to justify their existence?}
  \item{Have all obligatory non-functional requirements been accounted for, specifically those relating to legality, security or compliance that
        are imposed by entities outside of the system?}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Verification}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs.  Output is not how you
are going to return the results of the test.  The output is the expected
result.}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}
					
How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

How test will be performed: 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed:

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
