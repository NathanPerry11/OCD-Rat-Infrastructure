\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}

\par{The business of the user is to use the system to aid in the
creation and analysis of experiments relating to a large but fragmented data set
of rat trials that investigate compulsive behaviour of rats and how they relate to various 
factors such as drug injections or brain legions. This data set is comprised of videos of rats
moving on a flat surface, files of their (x,y) coordinates and plots that show the trajectories
of these coordinates. Users may want to
extract a concise set of pre-existing data that can be applicable to
their hypothesis to streamline their workflow and avoid the necessity of carrying out trials.
Users may also want to use the system to provide analysis on the data set as a means of
further supplementing ther academic work. This can include drawing behavioural metrics of the rats
based on various parameters (i.e. rate of compulsion based on injection type) or data visualizations
based similarily on compulsive behaviours as they relate to attributes of the rats.}

\lips
\subsection{Goals of the Project}

\par{The high-level goal of the project is to provide users in the field of behavioural sciences,
a unified and non-technical way of drawing from the vast amount of available data on OCD rat trials
to aid in their academic work and experiments. This will be accomplished via the following sub-goals:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a DBMS that provides query access to the entirety of the data set of rat trials as well as all metadata associated with the data.
    \item Provide a UI that makes querying this data approachable to non-technical users by incorporating familiar and intuitive filtering and searching techniques
    (Attribute filters, Natural Language search bar). Further the UI must provide users with pre-generated query options that are likely to
    be useful for users that may not know where to start. This could include selecting all rat trials of a particular drug injection along with
    all saline control data.
    \item Provide an algorithm that can identify compulsive behaviour by looking at each rat trial
    and provide options for behavioural metrics and data visualizations based on various attributes that the user can extract 
    for their purposes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}

\par{The clients for this project are Dr. Henry Szechtman and Dr. Anna Dvorkin-Gheva, two professors at McMaster University who are experts in
the fields of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences and Bioinformatics, respectively. They have worked extensively with these OCD rat trials and
were responsible for generating and depositing this data in the FRDR repository where it currently is stored. Dr. Szechtman and Dr. Dvorkin-Gheva want
to drastically improve the availability of the vast data set they have created so that the trials they conducted can become useful to other students and academics in related fields.}
\lips
\subsection{Customer}

\par{Since our application is intended to be open-source and accessible to the public for free, our customers will simply be a group of end-users
of our application. Our end users will primarily involve behavioural neuroscience researchers like Dr. Henry Szechtman and Dr. Anna Dvorkin-Gheva, 
as well as graduate students and lab members, who will all benefit from the user-friendly and accessible functionality of the platform. 
Additionally we will have data scientists as customers, who will benefit from our application architecture anf offered functionality for 
their purposes. Lastly, collaborating institutions and organizations from the open research community will be users of our application, 
since the application is intended to be free-use and accessible to all.}

    Collaborative System & System Overview \\
    \hline
    FRDR Repository & The Federated Research Data Repository is a 'bilingual bilingual publishing 
    platform for sharing and 
    preserving Canadian research data. 
    It is a curated, general-purpose repository, 
    custom built for large datasets.' This is where the data set of the rat trials is physically located
    and is dispersed across 29 independent datasets. Our system will provide a unified database schema but will
    pull data from this repository.\\
    \hline
    ratbat.mcmaster.ca & While not a directly collaborative system, this is a system made by a previous years' capstone
    team to address the same problem that our system seeks to. It will be a collaborative system in the sense that ir provides
    a reference of potential ways to approach our solution, ideas that work well and can be carried forward
    and providing visibility to shortcomings of the system will help us to avoid repeating mistakes. \\

\subsection{Budget Constraints}

\par{There is very limited budget available for this project. The department of Computing and Software at McMaster University 
will provide \$125 CAD for approved expenses. Outside of that funding, we are asked not to exceed spending of \$500 CAD
culmulatively as a team. Thus, the total budget constraints for this project are \$500 CAD in total and \$375 of our team's personal funding.}
