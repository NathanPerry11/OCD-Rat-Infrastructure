\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}

\par{The business of the user is to use the system to aid in the
creation and analysis of experiments relating to a large but fragmented data set
of \gls{rat-behavioral-trials} that investigate compulsive behaviour of rats and how they relate to various 
factors such as drug injections or brain legions. This data set is comprised of videos of rats
moving on a flat surface, files of their (x,y) coordinates and plots that show the \gls{trajectory} of these coordinates. Users may want to
extract a concise set of pre-existing data that can be applicable to
their hypothesis to streamline their workflow and avoid the necessity of carrying out trials.
Users may also want to use the system to provide analysis on the data set as a means of
further supplementing their academic work. This can include drawing \gls{behavioral-metrics} of the rats
based on various parameters (i.e. rate of compulsion based on injection type) or data visualizations
based similarly on compulsive behaviours as they relate to attributes of the rats.}

\lips

\subsection{Goals of the Project}

\par{The high-level goal of the project is to provide users in the field of behavioural sciences,
a unified and non-technical way of drawing from the vast amount of available data on \gls{ocd} rat trials
to aid in their academic work and experiments. This will be accomplished via the following sub-goals:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a \gls{dbms} that provides \gls{query} access to the entirety of the data set of \gls{rat-behavioral-trials} as well as all \gls{metadata} associated with the data.
    \item Provide a UI that makes querying this data approachable to non-technical users by incorporating familiar and intuitive filtering and searching techniques
    (Attribute filters, Natural Language search bar). Further the UI must provide users with pre-generated query options that are likely to
    be useful for users that may not know where to start. This could include selecting all rat trials of a particular drug injection along with
    all saline control data.
    \item Provide an algorithm that can identify compulsive behaviour by looking at each rat trial
    and provide options for behavioural metrics and data visualizations based on various attributes that the user can extract 
    for their purposes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stakeholders}

\subsection{Client}
\label{sec:2.1client}
\par{The clients for this project are Dr. Henry Szechtman and Dr. Anna Dvorkin-Gheva, two professors at McMaster University who are experts in
the fields of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences and Bioinformatics, respectively. They have worked extensively with these \gls{ocd} rat trials and
were responsible for generating and depositing this data in the \gls{frdr} repository where it currently is stored. Dr. Szechtman and Dr. Dvorkin-Gheva want
to drastically improve the availability of the vast data set they have created so that the trials they conducted can become useful to other students and academics in related fields. \\\\}

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}

\par{Other stakeholders for our project would be defined as any person or group of interest in the project outside the 
client and the customer. The first one would be our group, Gouda Engineers, as our task is to turn the project from the 
client/customer’s idea to a real product. We focus on creating documentation, building code, testing and deploying the 
software. Another stakeholder is our TA, Tiago de Moraes Machado, who is there to help our group along the way with our 
project by keeping us on track and providing feedback where it is needed. Lastly, our professor, Dr. Spencer Smith and our 
class, Capstone 4G06, would be the final stakeholders as they provide the guide and structure for building the project, 
knowledge on the topics for each step, and feedback where it is needed.}

\section{Mandated Constraints}
\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\lips
\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}

\par{The OCD rat trial data set is currently hosted and accessible on the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR), 
a Canadian national platform for research data management and sharing. The current environment has the following components:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Environment}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users currently access datasets on FRDR through a standard web browser such as Google Chrome.
        \item No special software or hardware is needed, users can use any personal device such as their laptop or a mobile device.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data and Metadata Storage}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The data set and its associated metadata are stored in FRDR's cloud-based infrastructure.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hosting and Maintenance}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item FRDR's cloud-based infrastructure is maintained by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada.
        \item FRDR's infrastructure incorporates redundant storage and regular data backups to ensure long-term data preservation and protection.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Access and Technical Interfaces}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users can access and view the data set through FRDR's web portal.
        \item Data accessed through the web portal can be downloaded through links on the web page.
        \item FRDR also exposes an API specifically for data set querying and retrieval.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\par{The following diagram is a rough outline of the form of the current system:}

\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
\lips

\begin{tabular}{|m{5cm}|m{10cm}|}
    \hline
    Collaborative System & System Overview \\
    \hline
    FRDR Repository & The Federated Research Data Repository is a 'bilingual bilingual publishing 
    platform for sharing and 
    preserving Canadian research data. 
    It is a curated, general-purpose repository, 
    custom built for large datasets.' This is where the data set of the rat trials is physically located
    and is dispersed across 29 independent datasets. Our system will provide a unified database schema but will
    pull data from this repository.\\
    \hline
    ratbat.mcmaster.ca & While not a directly collaborative system, this is a system made by a previous years' capstone
    team to address the same problem that our system seeks to. It will be a collaborative system in the sense that ir provides
    a reference of potential ways to approach our solution, ideas that work well and can be carried forward
    and providing visibility to shortcomings of the system will help us to avoid repeating mistakes. \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall make use of the FRDR API in order to fetch the relevant data from the data set as we will not be hosting a seperate database to physically store the data for our system
    \item In the case of implementing natural language processing, an Off-the-Shelf LLM will be used to accomplish this (In other words we will not be writing our own LLM model for this purpose).
    Note that this model may need to be trained to provide results that are acceptable for our purposes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}

The anticipated workplace environment for the software system includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The workspace is defined as the computer environment where the software will operate.
    \item The system is expected to be used primarily on standard desktop or laptop computers with modern operating systems such as Windows, macOS, or Linux.
    \item Users will access the system through web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Safari) or dedicated client applications, depending on the software configuration.
    \item The system may require external software installed to run locally, such as Docker and Kubernetes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Schedule Constraints}

\par{Due to the nature of the capstone course, the scheduling constraints
map directly to dates in which major deliverable related to the project are due in the capstone course.
They are laid out below:}

\subsection{Budget Constraints}

\par{There is very limited budget available for this project. The department of Computing and Software at McMaster University 
will provide \$125 CAD for approved expenses. Outside of that funding, we are asked not to exceed spending of \$500 CAD
culmulatively as a team. Thus, the total budget constraints for this project are \$500 CAD in total and \$375 of our team's personal funding.}

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The entirety of the data set that is being worked with is available in the FRDR repository
    but is fragmented into 29 independent dats sets. 29 being the number of studies written that required relevant
    rat trials to be performed.
    \item The culmination of all the relevant data for this project is 11 terabytes and contains nearly 60,000 data objects with
    20,000 hours of video files alone.
    \item Every data object has many metadata annotations (or attributes) associated within them. In the current data hosting
    implementation on the FRDR, these are all contained in a README file that is stored in the root directory of each dataset.
    This README file has a row for each data object in the dataset and columns for each attribute.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Business Rules}

    \par{This system does not exist within a traditional business environment and is
    rather in the realm of academia. As a result, there are no specific business rules that shape
    the requirements, the system acts as a tool in academic pursuits. Additionally, any business rules
    related to protection of information do not apply as all data being used is publicly available to
    the general public already. }

\subsection{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The availability and accessibility of the data in the FRDR will be upheld in definitely or at least for the lifecycle of this project.
    \item The system will not at any point, need to physically store any of the relevant data and can use the FRDR as a datastore.
    \item The API provided by the FRDR repository will be made available for our use.
    \item The query performance of the FRDR API will be reasonably efficient for our purposes.
    \item An out of the box machine learning model(s) will be available and capable of being trained in a way that it can
    perform natural language queries and categorization of rat behaviours. 
    \item API requests to the repository are independent of the user's operating system and device state. i.e. Users
    will not require any setup on their local machine to use the system.

\end{itemize}


\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}

\par{ The current situation currently revolves the \gls{frdr} as a means
of depositing and extracting data. Dr. Henry Szechtman and Dr. Anna Dvorkin-Gheva have
deposited the relevant data related to their work into this repository. The repository
has this data seperated into 29 distinct datasets, based on the specific study the data relates to.
Additionally, there is a large amount of metadata that is not well related to the data objects it describes
(it is stored in a readme file in each dataset which is seperate from the actual data objects). As a result, while
users are able to access all of the available data, it is very fragmented, nearly impossible to filter and search
effectively and hard to leverage for any specific research purposes. \newline\newline

Additionally, the project from last year, \href{https://ratbat.mcmaster.ca}{RatBat}, is also pulling from the \gls{frdr}
dataset using its provided API. Please see below of a graphical layout of the current situation.}

\section{The Scope of the Product}

\subsection{Product Boundary}
The product is a web-based data analysis platform designed specifically for the Dr. Szechtman Lab’s OCD behavioral neuroscience dataset. Its scope includes database design, backend services, frontend user interfaces, and data analysis pipelines to enable global researchers to access, search, analyze, and visualize rat behavioral data.

\textbf{In-Scope Features}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database and Backend}: PostgreSQL schema, FastAPI endpoints, metadata management, video file management.
    \item \textbf{Frontend}: Up to date interface with advanced search/filtering, trajectory visualization, and intuitive design for non-technical researchers.
    \item \textbf{Data Processing}: Python based analysis tools for behavioral metrics, pattern detection algorithms, automated workflows, and an extensible architecture for future video-based analysis.
    \item \textbf{Deployment and Accessibility}: A fully deployed platform accessible to international researchers, with documentation, tutorials, and open-source analysis tools.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Out-of-Scope Features}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Direct integration with external datasets outside the OCD rat data repository.
    \item Real-time data collection from new experiments (focus is on analysis of existing dataset).
    \item Advanced machine learning video recognition (future extensibility only, not initial deliverable).
\end{itemize}

This boundary ensures the platform delivers a usable, scalable, and research-ready tool while avoiding scope creep into areas requiring separate infrastructure or regulatory compliance.

\end{itemize}

\section{Security Requirements}
\subsection{Access Requirements}

\par{There are no access requirements for our system, since it will be publicly accessible.}

\subsection{Integrity Requirements}

\par{The product shall prevent itself, the databases, and other files within it from intentional abuse.}

\subsection{Privacy Requirements}

\par{The system does not collect or use any user-related data that could be considered private and/or confidential. \newline \indent
The system does not store any personal or sensitive personal data, it only stores and presents the data which is already 
publicly available through FRDR. \newline \indent There are no privacy requirements for the system.}

use of user data, it only offers the searching and presentation of an existing public data set. \newline \indent We have consent from our 
supervisors, Dr. Henry Szechtman and Dr. Anna Dvorkin-Gheva to use their data set in the development of the project. Additionally, 
we are allowed to reference the work of the capstone group, ratbat.mcmaster.ca, which they supervised during the previous year.}

\subsection{Standards Compliance Requirements}
\lips

\section{Open Issues}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Verification of the specific capabilities of the \gls{frdr} \gls{api} have not yet been investigated.
    \item The extraction of the metadata of each data object is not complete and the process for extracting/referencing the metadata
    into a relational database schema has not yet completed.
    \item An investigation into the ability for an Off-the-Shelf \gls{llm} model to accurately identify compulsive behavior in the
    \gls{rat-behavioral-trials} is not yet complete.
\end{itemize}

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}

Several open source or commercially available products provide out of the box functionality relevant to the project. These include: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Databases 
    \item[] Products like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and AWS RDS are database offerings that provide robust data storage and indexing capabilities. These products meet the needs for data management at scale, but may require customization to fit the project's use. 
    \item Artificial Intelligence 
    \item[] Google's Vertex AI and the OpenAI API offer a suite of products pertaining to natural language processing and image analysis. These may be effective tools for the natural language and data processing tools central to the project, but require integration with a third party API external to the system. Specialized tools like \href{https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut}{DeepLabCut} offer open-source tools for animal behavioral analysis. 

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Reusable Components}

Dr. Henry Szechtman and Dr. Anna Dvorkin-Gheva possess several pre-existing software modules that can be incorporated into the system with minimal modification. This suite of tools exists as a system called \href{https://github.com/brandonc-edu/RatBAT/tree/main}{RatBat}: a previous effort to implement an interactive data platform for the OCD rodent dataset. These modules include components for interfacing with the existing dataset, as well as tools for querying the dataset. The existing \href{https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giac092}{database} includes an extensive set of trials, outcomes, and metadata comprising a core reusable project component.

\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}


The client has provided several resources to serve as references for the implementation of the system. One similar interface is the \href{https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/analysis_page?app=CohortBuilder&tab=general_diagnosis}{GDC Data Portal} which provides a querying interface that may be replicated by the system. Furthermore, the client expressed a goal of incorporating a user-friendly, e-commerce-like catalogue interface, citing retailers such as \href{https://amazon.ca}{Amazon} as a reference for user interface design. 


\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}

The new system will be developed from the ground up, there is no current implementation environment to affect. The only existing system that will be interacted with is the FRDR repository which provides
a stable API for accessing the relevant data sets that will be used and will thus be unaffected by any developments made.

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}

\par{ The 'installed system' that concerns this project is the FRDR repository as it will be used as a part of the system to provide the required functionality. The interactions between the new system and
the FRDR repository will all be through a REST API that the FRDR provides. As a result no effects or conflicts are anticipated, although this conclusion operates under the assumption that the provided
API is sound. }


\subsection{Potential User Problems}

\par{An important note to make about the project is that it is not a mandatory replacement for the existing data set and infrastructure 
available through FRDR. Users besides the commissioners of our project, our supervisors, can simply keep using the existing system 
if that better suits their needs. \newline \indent The comissioners of our project, and external users of the project due to its public 
availability, could have a potential issue with the Natural Language Processing (NLP) used in querying raw data files. Since natural language 
will be converted to a query statement using an AI model, it cannot be guaranteed the model will be accurate 100\% of the time when 
creating these queries from natural language.}

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}

\par{There are no requirements for migration to the new product other than that the user must familiarize themselves with the new domain and UI if they are used to using the FRDR repository.}


\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}

\par{The new system will take the raw data directly from the FRDR repository and present it to users. There are use cases in which the data will be processed for the purposes 
     of producing metrics or visualizations which is relevant to the functional requirements rather than this section. Thus, no data needs to be modified or translated for this new system.}

\section{Costs}

\par{There are no costs associated with the development of this project.}

\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall be released alongside a user manual guiding users through the possible inputs they have access to, how to properly execute them as well as the corresponding outputs that will be produced as a result. The inputs that 
    will be over: querying pre-packaged result sets, generating custom filters, natural language searching, producing behaviour metrics, producing data visualizations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Requirements}

\par{ There are no explicit training requirements for this system. The interface should be sufficiently intuitive and the user manual must be interpretable by a non-technical user if they need to learn specific functions.
No explicit training will be needed }
