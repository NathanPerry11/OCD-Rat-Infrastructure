\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads}
{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

%\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
%not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
%place.}

\par{All data that will be used in any matter over the duration of this project is already publicly available on the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR)
thus no confidential information will be contained in this project.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\paragraph{There is no IP to protect for the project. The data provided is openly avaiable to use. Likewise, our code will be open source.}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\paragraph{The software that we will use will be MIT. The License is linked titled LICENSE and is at the root directory of our repository.}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

%\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

%\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
%caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

%\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

%\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
%in-person.}

\par{Meetings will occur every Monday from 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. and every Friday 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. Meetings will
be in person in MDCL 2246. If extra meetings are needed, they will be scheduled on an ad-hoc basis with priority given to pre-established capstone timeslots.

Our group will plan to meet with the project supervisors once per week. This is simply a guideline and ad-hoc meetings
will be added as needed. Additionally, all project documents will be forwarded to the supervisors to keep them in the loop and receive any feedback they want to provide.

Tim Pokanai is the group leader and thus will be responsible for leading team meetings. An agenda with the necessary 
discussion items will be collaboratively created ahead of time (likely through text).

A kanban board has been created on github for aiding in communication and work splitting. All action items for each deliverable will
be added to the kanban board so that team members can claim sections they are working on.
}

%\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

%\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}
Our team will primarily communicate using Microsoft Teams and text messaging for quick, day-to-day coordination. For interactions with the professors associated with our project, we will schedule weekly or ad hoc meetings as needed. Email will be our main channel for formal communication with faculty.

To manage and divide work efficiently, we are utilizing GitHub Issues and a Kanban board. GitHub Issues allow us to assign tasks, track progress, and facilitate transparent communication among team members. The Kanban board complements this by providing a clear visual representation of task status and workflow. This will support project planning and execution.

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\paragraph{Roles} 

\begin{description}
    \item[Tim - Team Leader] Oversees members, helps assign tasks, and ensures deadlines are met.
    \item[Nathan - Administrator] Manages documentation, project logistics, and resources.
    \item[Leo - Meeting Chair] Organizes and leads team meetings, sets agendas, and keeps discussions on track.
    \item[Jeremy / Aidan - Software Specalists] Assist with development tasks such as CI/CD setup, code reviews, general project support, and note taking.
\end{description}


\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using git, including branches, pull requests, etc.?

  The team will use Git for version control. Branches will follow the convention:
  \texttt{<type-of-work>/<issue-name>}, where the types of work are:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item documentation
      \item feature
      \item bugfix
  \end{itemize}

  Issue name will follow the name of the issue you are working on.

  For pull requests, GitHub Actions will compile the code and run checks. A reviewer will always be required. Once a branch is merged, it will be deleted.

  \item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue classification, etc.?
  
  We will manage tasks and bugs using GitHub Issues. To ensure consistency and clarity, we will use issue templates for common types of issues such as feature requests, bug reports, and documentation tasks. Issues will be classified using labels (e.g., "bug", "enhancement", "in progress", "needs review") to track progress and priority. Each issue will be assigned to a team member and linked to relevant pull requests when applicable. This structured approach will help us maintain transparency, accountability, and effective collaboration throughout the development process.

  \item Use of CI/CD
  
  We will implement Githb actions for CI/CD. This will include automated checks to ensure that the code compiles correctly, passes all tests, and adheres to project standards before being merged into the main branch. By integrating CI/CD, we aim to catch issues early, maintain code quality, and streamline the deployment process.  



\end{itemize}


\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  
  We will create GitHub issues for each task, and maintain a Kanban board for issues related to the current deliverable.
  

  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}
